Kubernetes : kubernetes is also known as K8s.Because there are 8 charcters between K and s.


---> Kubernetes is a container management tool or container orchestration tool.

---> It is developed by google and later donated to CNCF.(Cloud Native Computing Foundation)

---> It is an open source and written in GO language.


What is Container orchestration tool
-------------------------------------

---> Container orchestration tool manages the containerized applications.

---> Container orchestration tool or engine automates deploying,scaling,load balancing and managing containerized application on a  group of servers.

---> Actions done by container orchestration tool are:-

1. Deploying
2. Scheduling
3. Scaling
4. Load Balancing
5. Batch execution
6. Roll Backs
7. Monitoring


Features of kubernetes :-
------------------------
1. Automatic Bin Packing
2. Service Discovery & Load Balancing
3. Storage Orchestration
4. Self Healing

Automatic Bin Packing :-
-----------------------

---> Kubernetes will take care of packaging these jobs(containers) in bins(Servers) in the most efficient way.

---> Kubernetes automatically packages your application and schedules the container based on the requirements and resources available.

---> Kubernetes Automatically places containers based on their resource requirements like CPU & RAM, while not sacrificing availability saves resources.

---> We have a option to specify a pod, so you can optionally specify how much CPU & RAM each container needs. When containers have resource requests specified, the scheduler can make better decisions about which nodes to place pods on.


Pods & Nodes :-
---------------

---> In kubernetes we cannot intract with containers directly, The containers are wraped inside the pods.

---> The pod can contain single container or multiple containers.

---> The pods are housed inside the nodes.

---> A node can contain single pod or multiple podes.

---> A pod contains storage resorces.

---> kubernetes Provides the unique IP address to each and every Pod.


Service Discovery & Load Balancing :-
-------------------------------------

---> Pods receive thier own IP addresses from kubernetes,with it assigns a single domain name system (DNS) name to a set of containers to aid in load balancing requests across the containers of the set.

---> Pods that have same set of functions are abstracted into sets, called services.

---> A kubernetes service is a set of pods that work together.

---> Kubernetes gives pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for set of pods and can load-balance across them.

---> By considering above point, kubernetes has control over network and communication between pods and can load balance across them.

Storage Orchestration :-
-----------------------

---> kuberenetes allows to select the storage system of your choice. you can either opt for local storage, or choose a public cloud provider such as AWS or perhaps use a shared network storage system such as NFS ETC.

---> Containers running inside a pod may need to store the data.

---> Pods can have a storage volumes.


Self Healing :-
--------------

1. If a container fails ---> It restarts the container.

2. If node dies ---> Replaces and Reschedule containers on other nodes.

3. If container does not respond to user defined health check ---> It kills the container.

---> This processes are take care by Replication controller.
